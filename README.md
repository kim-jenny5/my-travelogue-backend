# my travelogue

## Background

my travelogue is a single-page application where users can keep a log of their trips/vacations and create a list of their itinerary for each trip. With this web application, users can see a list of all the past and upcoming trips on their dashboard and organize their itinerary. With a counter for how many days are left till the next upcoming trip, users will find further joy in anticipating their already exciting trips.

## Tech Stack

The backend was created with Rails API and has been fully set up with user authentication, using the `bcrpyt` gem and JWT. The [frontend](https://github.com/kim-jenny5/tableau-dambiance-frontend) was done with React, JavaScript, and HTML, with the design being mostly done with CSS in addition to some MUI.

## Usage

Live API is coming...

In the meantime, to start up the API locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle` or `bundle install` to install the gems ðŸ’Ž
3. Run `rake db:migrate`
4. Run `rails s`
5. Proceed to `localhost:3000` in your browser, or whichever port the terminal provides you.
